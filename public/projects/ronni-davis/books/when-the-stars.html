              full of heart and hope, truth and acceptance, that tackles the

              to end.

          For fans of Nicola Yoon comes an intense first-love romance between
          two teens who are torn apart after one summer by prejudice and mental
          illness, only to find each other once again.

        <p>Is the universe big enough for her dreams?</p>
        <p>Eighteen-year-old Devon longs for two things.</p>
        <p>
          The stars.<br />And the boy she fell in love with one unforgettable
          summer.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Ashton broke Devon's heart at the end of the most romantic and
          magical summer of her life, she thought she'd never heal. But over the
          course of the following year, Devon slowly managed to put the pieces
          back together for the sake of her dream to become an astrophysicist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it's senior year, and she's determined to enjoy every moment as
          she prepares for a future of studying the galaxies. That is, until
          Ashton shows up on the first day of school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their chemistry is undeniable, but something feels different. As the
          spark in his eyes grows dimmer, Devon discovers parts of Ashton he's
          been hiding. Is he the same person she fell in love with that summer?
          And will her feelings for him eclipse her love of the stars?

          12), is a sensitive take on loving someone who is battling depression
          as well as the challenges of an interracial relationship across social
          class lines where one party's parents are prejudiced. It has the added
          bonus of a female protagonist of color with a passion for the
